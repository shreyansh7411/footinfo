In the 2024–25 season he became one of Auxerre's primary chance-creators and finishers — combining smart late runs into the box with accurate short and through passes. Defensively he presses the half-space and often recovers loose balls, while in possession he alternates between quick one-twos and diagonal links to switch play. Off the ball he reads opposition lines well, and his set-piece involvement (corners and wide free-kicks) produced several assists.

Operating primarily as a box-to-box midfielder, Santos is equally comfortable dictating the tempo in deep positions and surging forward into the final third. His ability to carry the ball through pressure zones and his knack for finding forward passing lanes have made him the heartbeat of Strasbourg's midfield this season. At just 20 years old, he already plays with the composure of a seasoned veteran, showcasing a calmness under pressure that belies his age. In several Ligue 1 fixtures, including a standout performance against Lyon where he both scored and assisted, he demonstrated his ability to turn games with decisive contributions. His resilience in defensive transitions — tracking runners, breaking up play, and immediately initiating counters — gives Strasbourg balance, while his eye for goal adds a dangerous edge. Many in Alsace see him as a future captain in the making."

Having developed his reputation at New England Revolution in MLS before moving to Europe, Petrović carries a calm authority in high-pressure moments. His penalty-saving record is already among the best in the league, with a crucial stop against Marseille cementing his status as Strasbourg's defensive anchor. Beyond reflexes, his proactive sweeping style allows Strasbourg to play with a higher defensive line, as he is quick off his line to intercept through balls. His distribution has also improved dramatically, frequently initiating fast counters with accurate long kicks to the wingers. Fans at Stade de la Meinau have grown to trust him not just as a goalkeeper, but as a leader — barking instructions to defenders and keeping the back line organized. In many ways, Petrović embodies Strasbourg's resilience and ambition."

Bakwa thrives in one-on-one duels, often using quick changes of pace and sharp feints to unbalance defenders. His left-footed shots when cutting inside from the right wing have already produced several highlight-reel goals, including a curling strike against Nice that left fans in awe. More than just an individualist, he has matured tactically under Liam Rosenior, showing improved decision-making in the final third — whether that's choosing when to take on his man, or when to slip in a teammate with a perfectly timed pass. His defensive work rate has also improved, pressing opponents high and contributing to Strasbourg's collective intensity.

His tactical intelligence is perhaps his strongest asset: he constantly drifts into pockets of space that disrupt defensive structures, offering passing lanes to midfielders. He has shown composure in front of goal, scoring five times this season, but also an unselfish streak in providing assists. One memorable display came against Rennes, where he dropped deep to dictate play and then arrived late in the box to finish off a sweeping move. His stamina and pressing are also critical to Rosenior's system, as he tirelessly harries defenders and contributes to the collective defensive effort.

Despite being just 20, he already demonstrates confidence in taking responsibility during high-pressure moments, such as his late assist in Strasbourg's comeback win over Montpellier. His creativity is not limited to wide areas; Moreira frequently drifts inside to link with midfielders, showing vision with incisive through balls. His defensive commitment is still developing, but Rosenior has been molding him into a more complete player by demanding pressing intensity and positional awareness.
