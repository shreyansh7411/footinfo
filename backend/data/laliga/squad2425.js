He is known for his calmness on the ball and ability to build from the back. Eric often initiates plays with short, accurate passes and diagonal switches.

Despite criticism in past seasons, he's shown noticeable improvements this year. He reads the game well, anticipating passes and making clean interceptions. Eric is strong in aerial duels and marks tightly inside the box. Flick has utilized him in rotations, trusting his tactical discipline and experience. His leadership is growing, mentoring younger defenders like Cubarsí. He maintains composure in high-pressure moments and avoids rash decisions. Eric's technical background fits perfectly in Barcelona's possession-based system. His focus and adaptability allow him to play both in a back two or three. He's reliable in domestic competitions and a solid squad option for Europe. Eric's performances have earned renewed trust among fans and coaching staff.

Often deployed as a central or box-to-box midfielder, Olasagasti's biggest strengths lie in his positional sense, clean passing, and capacity to retain the ball under pressure. Though not flashy, his intelligent movement and ability to recycle possession help maintain the team's rhythm, especially when operating in tight spaces or during build-up phases. He is also a responsible defender, often tracking back and covering full-backs or deeper midfielders with discipline. While still developing his attacking output, his understanding of space and work ethic ensure that he remains in contention for regular minutes. Olasagasti exemplifies the smart, technically sound midfielders that have become Real Sociedad's trademark in recent years."

            description: "Robert Navarro is a creative left-footed attacking midfielder whose flair, intelligence, and technique add spark to Mallorca's offensive transitions. Developed in La Masia and further molded at Real Sociedad, Navarro brings elite-level training and a calmness in possession that belies his age. He excels in tight spaces and has a natural ability to glide past defenders, frequently acting as a link between midfield and the forward line. With an eye for through balls and late box entries, Navarro adds unpredictability to Mallorca's otherwise pragmatic setup. Though still developing consistency and end product, his movement off the ball and understanding of spatial dynamics make him a dangerous option in attacking midfield. He's also versatile — capable of drifting wide, playing centrally, or acting as a shadow striker. His technical quality makes him a long-term creative asset for Mallorca."

His greatest strength is in one-on-one offensive situations, where he uses acceleration and trickery to beat defenders and deliver dangerous crosses into the box. Defensively, he relies on recovery speed rather than physicality, and while he can be caught out of position at times, his engine allows him to cover large areas effectively. Mojica also offers versatility, being able to play as a traditional full-back or more advanced wing-back. A Copa América veteran, he brings experience and attacking thrust to Mallorca's left flank."

His technical mastery, ambidextrous control, and leadership on and off the pitch brought calm and creativity in equal measure. Cazorla's journey — from Oviedo to Villarreal, Arsenal, and back — is a testament to resilience and love for the game. In 2024–25, he mentored younger midfielders, orchestrated play with flair, and reconnected with fans who revered him as a symbol of hope.
