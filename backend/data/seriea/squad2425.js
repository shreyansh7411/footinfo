Off the ball he's relentless—closing center-backs, curving his runs to shade passing lanes, and forcing hurried clearances that create second-ball opportunities for Verona's midfield. In the box he thrives on early crosses and near-post darts, while in build-up he'll drop to receive on the half-turn, link with the winger, and then burst beyond to stretch the defense. Though still refining his timing and composure in tight areas, Mosquera's ceiling is evident: a high-energy No. 9 whose movement and work rate tilt matches in Verona's favor and whose adaptability gives the staff tactical flexibility between a 4-3-3 and a two-striker setup."
