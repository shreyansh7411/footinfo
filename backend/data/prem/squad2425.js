Known for his pace, power, and relentless running, he constantly stretches defenses. Núñez has improved his finishing, converting more chances than in his debut campaign. His movement has become smarter, timing runs better to avoid offsides. He remains unpredictable, capable of the spectacular as well as the scrappy. His link-up play with Salah and Díaz has developed, adding balance to the frontline. He is also an asset in pressing from the front, hassling defenders into mistakes. Despite some missed chances, his goal output has increased steadily. Núñez is a fan favorite for his passion and energy, even when he doesn't score. His aerial ability provides another weapon on set pieces. In 2024/25, he has added more assists to his game, becoming a provider as well as a scorer. He still has room to grow, but his ceiling is enormous. Liverpool's attack looks dynamic with him at full confidence. The Uruguayan is proving why the club invested heavily in him."

He combined intelligent off-the-ball movement with a clinical finish, supplying teammates and scoring from around the box. Palmer played across the attacking midfield and wide channels, giving Maresca a versatile option to rotate between #8 and #10 roles. His 24/25 numbers (52 apps, 18 goals, 14 assists) underline how he carried Chelsea's final third output. Palmer's first touch and ability to play through lines made him a constant threat on counter-attacks. He also improved his defensive work-rate, pressing higher and tracking back when needed. Set-pieces and late runs into the box became regular parts of his goal-scoring routine. Tactically, he's comfortable receiving between the lines and turning to exploit half-spaces.

His crossing improved markedly, and he produced a handful of moments where his individual brilliance unlocked stubborn defences. He adapted well to Maresca's pressing triggers, often starting the high press and recovering possession high up the pitch.

His tackling and recovery pace helped Chelsea limit wide overloads, while his passing range supported quick transitions. He frequently combined with the left winger to create overloads and was willing to take on risked vertical passes into the box. While occasionally exposed against direct counters, his stamina and work-rate allowed him to recover positionally.

A key highlight came in Brentford's 3–2 win over Chelsea, where he scored twice and showcased his composure under pressure. Tactically, Mbeumo thrives on pressing from the front, exploiting defensive lapses with clever diagonal runs, and using his strong left foot to cut inside and shoot with precision. Beyond the numbers, he stepped into a leadership role following Ivan Toney's departure, embracing the responsibility of being the focal point of attack. His form not only boosted Brentford to safety but also elevated his reputation across Europe, attracting interest from Champions League clubs.

His technical ability shone through in matches where Brentford needed ingenuity to break compact defenses, with his curling free-kick against Fulham being one of the goals of the season. Operating mainly as an attacking midfielder, he often dropped deep to orchestrate play, linking midfield and attack with vision and flair. His ability to drift into half-spaces forced opponents to adjust their defensive shape, creating room for runners like Mbeumo and Wissa. Damsgaard's return to prominence wasn't just statistical—it was symbolic, as he reminded fans of his talent after difficult years plagued by injuries.

Beyond his defensive duties, Collins chipped in with 2 goals from set pieces, further underlining his importance at both ends of the pitch. A standout performance came in a 2–0 victory over West Ham, where he won nearly every aerial duel and scored the opening header. His composure in possession allowed Brentford to build from the back, and his willingness to step into midfield with the ball demonstrated tactical maturity beyond his years.

Wissa's explosive pace, sharp movement in the box, and ability to finish with either foot made him a constant threat. His brace in the 4–1 demolition of Aston Villa highlighted his killer instinct, while his last-minute winner against Crystal Palace became a defining moment of Brentford's season. Beyond the goals, Wissa's work ethic and pressing intensity epitomized Keith Andrews' high-energy style, with the forward often the first to chase lost causes and harry defenders. For DR Congo, he has become a national hero, carrying the hopes of a football-loving country on the international stage.

In 2024/25 he was used both as a narrow right winger and as a roaming No.10, linking wide combinations with overlapping full-backs. His decision-making in transition is a feature—often pausing to draw pressure before releasing the runner—while his defensive work is tidy if unspectacular. He chipped in with end product across the campaign, posting 24 Premier League appearances with 3 goals and 2 assists, providing veteran poise in a young attack."

He is proactive pressing wide channels, reading back-passes to spring counters, and he tracks runners well to his own box.  On the ball he favors early low crosses across the six-yard line and quick wall passes to free the overlapping full-back.

He varies his final-third actions—underlaps to cut back from the byline and inverted runs to connect around the box.

Bueno developed his career in Spain with Girona, where he built his reputation as a reliable ball-playing centre-back, and his transition to the Premier League has been marked by resilience and adaptability.

At Wolves, he has been deployed as both a deep-lying playmaker and an advanced midfielder, using his clean passing range to break defensive lines and link midfield to attack. Doyle excels at set-pieces, frequently delivering dangerous corners and free-kicks with precision.

A South Korean international and a key figure for his national team, Hwang combines explosive pace with an instinct for attacking spaces behind defenders. His pressing intensity makes him a nightmare for opposition defenders, constantly harrying them into mistakes, while his finishing—especially in one-on-one situations—has been a major asset for Wolves. Hwang has scored crucial goals against top opposition, earning a reputation for stepping up in big moments. Although his playing style is high-risk and can lead to inconsistency, when in form he is Wolves' most decisive attacking threat. His versatility allows him to play as a central striker, a second forward, or on the wings, making him invaluable to Vítor Pereira's tactical setup."
